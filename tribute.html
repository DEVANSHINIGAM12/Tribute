      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <h3>(Early Life)</h3>
    <p>Dr. Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar, popularly known as Babasaheb Ambedkar, was an Indian jurist, economist, politician.
      Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar was born on 14 April 1891 in the Mhow Army Cantonment, Central Provinces (present-day Madhya Pradesh) 
        to a Dalit family. His family’s low caste status resulted in his early life being marked by discrimination,
         segregation and untouchability.</p>

         <h3>(Role in India’s Independence Movement)</h3>
        <p>Ambedkar’s role in the independence struggle was complex. Unlike the dominant political discourse
           that focused on persuading the British to cede greater power to Indians, and to eventually leave India,
            Ambedkar’s interventions and advocacy centred more around the protection and furtherance of Dalit rights.
             As a result, he often clashed with the Indian National Congress.</p>

             <h3>(Contribution To Constitution Making )</h3>
             <p>Ambedkar became a key figure in India’s constitution-making 
              process due to the offices he held and his interventions and speeches in the Assembly. 
              He was the Chairman of the Assembly’s most crucial committee – the Drafting Committee and 
              a member of other important Committees. As its Chairman, he had to defend the Draft Constitution 
              which the Committee prepared, and therefore intervened in nearly every debate.</p>

                    <h3>(Legacy)</h3>
                         <p>Ambedkar was the principal architect of the Constitution of India and is often referred to as the
                            "Father of the Indian Constitution." He was also the first Law Minister of independent India.
                               His tireless efforts to eradicate social evils and promote equality continue to inspire millions.
                              His legacy is marked by his invaluable contributions to the upliftment of the marginalized sections of 
                              society and his relentless pursuit of justice and equality.</p>
